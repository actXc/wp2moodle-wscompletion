/**
 * Readme file for ws_completion
 * The purpose of this plugin is to expose course completions per user as a web service
 * Relies on the Certificate plugin (https://github.com/markn86/moodle-mod_certificate)
 * creates a couple of new VIEWs in the database, but doesn't add any new tables, fields, etc,
 * so should be compatible with everything. Also exposes the users.idnumber column as 'WPUserId'
